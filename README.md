# Help to translate
Yuki needs a little help on getting to speak in your language! It requires your help for her to recongise more from the world and understand your language.

## How can I translate?
You can translate by translating the language in the `/beta` folder to the language you'd like to and send it to us as a pull request.

However you can submit changes to the original `/beta/en.json` file to fix grammar mistakes or errors, if there is any.

## After-steps
The next step for the reward is being patient. 
Please wait up to `1-2` hours to add your translations to the bot. The role will be given to you in the support server and your name will appear on the constributors list.

### How should `/beta/locale.json` look like?

It's important to replace "Text here" to your language, don't forget to check the JSON file before submitting.

Anyway, here is an example on how your file should look
```json
{ 
    "error.unableExec": "Text here",
    "error.notInGuild": "Text here",
    "error.noUserSpec": "Text here",
    "error.UserBannable": "Text here",
    "error.categoryDisabled": "Text here",
    "error.serverOwner": "Text here",
    "error.Higher": "Text here",
    "error.self": "Text here",
    "warnedUser": "Text here",
    "embed.user": "Text here",
    "embed.mod": "Text here",
    "embed.reason": "Text here",
    "embed.warnIssued": "Text here",
    "warned": "Text here",
    "noPerm": "Text here",
    "help": "Text here"
}
```
## Can I edit the `/stable/locale.json` files?

Yes you can. But that one would be a lot more challenge then if you did the beta translations one. However, if you have ever translated in the beta version, those strings you translated will be put on the final version (stable) unless, if you fully translate the stable translations. But translating 89 strings (as of right now), is quite challenging.


## Thank you
Thank you for help Yuki learn a lot from your languages!
